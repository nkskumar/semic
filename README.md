# Semic : Semiconductor physics calculation and modeling

## What is it? (WIP)

**Semic** is a python package that allows you to model semiconductors and perform calculations with them.

## Main Features (WIP)

   - instantiate semiconductors as objects for calculations and modeling
   - ...
   - TBD

## Installation

    pip install semic

## TODO

   - Implement quantum mechanics subpackage (under review)
   - Complete material properties
   - Complete Carrier Distribution, Transport and Band structure
   - Start PN Junction
   - Start Free Surfaces and Metal-Semiconductor Interfaces
   - Start MOS Structure (Done!)
   - Start Heterostructures
   - Start FETs and BJTs (Done!)
   - Start Diodes (Done!)
   - Start Opto-electronic Devices
   - Add plotting support (ongoing)
   - Create documentation using Sphinx

## Future considerations

   - Try implementing some form of machine learning/deep learning
   - Magnetic Semiconductors
   - New device topologies
   - New materials!
