This is a work in progress. I will be adding code as I go along.

##### Date: 9/09/2021 (Sept. 9, 2021) Update 1
Added dynamics.py and fundamentals.py

dynamics.py contains several equations for hole dynamics (Group Velocity, Acceleration Theorem, Momentum relation, Energy of an electron. All of these are related to k, the wavector of a spatial wave. WIP

fundamentals.py contains several equations for finding the electron and hole (n and p) concentrations. WIP


##### Date: 9/09/2021 (Sept. 9, 2021) Update 2
Reworked find_pn() function in fundamentals.py

Added comments for functions

Worked on __init__.py

##### Date: 9/10/2021 (Sept. 10, 2021)

Added Bose-Einstein distribution to fundamentals.py

Renamed fermi_dirac_df() to fermi_dirac()

Added n0 and Nc functions.
